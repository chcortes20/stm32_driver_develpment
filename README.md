I am polishing and trying to maintain my embedded development knowledge since I currently do no do this as a career but hope to at some point. <br><br><br>

## stm32L4xx.h

This is a header file that is specific to the device I shose to develop the drivers for. 
The main items in this page are

- The base addresses of various memeories present in the microcontroller such as (Flash, SRAM1, ROM, etc)
- The base addresses of various bus domains such as (AHBx domain and APBx domain)
- The base addreses of various peripherals present in different bus domains of the microcontroller
- Clock management macros (i.e clock enable and clock dissbale macros)
- IRQ definitions 
- Peripheral Register definition structures 
- Peripheral Register bit definitions 
- **Other useful microcontroller configurations macros** 
- adding here as a test
